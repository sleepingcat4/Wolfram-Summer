RowBox[{"context = \n  \"Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by \\\ncomputers, as opposed to human or animal intelligence. \\\"Intelligence\\\n\\\" encompasses the ability to learn and to reason, to generalize, and \\\nto infer meaning.AI applications include advanced web search engines \\\n(e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, \\\nAmazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and \\\nAlexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools \\\n(ChatGPT and AI art), automated decision-making, and competing at the \\\nhighest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and \\\nGo).Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in \\\n1956, and in the years since it has experienced several waves of \\\noptimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known \\\nas an \\\"AI winter\\\"), followed by new approaches, success, and \\\nrenewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different \\\napproaches, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem \\\nsolving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge, and imitating \\\nanimal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly \\\nmathematical and statistical machine learning has dominated the \\\nfield, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to \\\nsolve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.The \\\nvarious sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular \\\ngoals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI \\\nresearch include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, \\\nlearning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to \\\nmove and manipulate objects. General intelligence (the ability to \\\nsolve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals. To \\\nsolve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a \\\nwide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and \\\nmathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, \\\nand methods based on statistics, probability, and economics. AI also \\\ndraws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and \\\nmany other fields.\nThe field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence \\\"can \\\nbe so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate \\\nit\\\". This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the \\\nethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with \\\nhuman-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored \\\nby myth, fiction (science fiction), and philosophy since antiquity. \\\nComputer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may \\\nbecome an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are \\\nnot steered towards goals beneficial to humankind. Economists have \\\nfrequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and \\\nspeculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy \\\nfor full employment. The term artificial intelligence has also been \\\ncriticized for overhyping AI's true technological capabilities.\n\nArtificial beings with intelligence appeared as storytelling devices \\\nin antiquity, and have been common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's \\\nFrankenstein or Karel \[CapitalCHacek]apek's R.U.R. These characters and their fates \\\nraised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of \\\nartificial intelligence.The study of mechanical or \\\"formal\\\" \\\nreasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. \\\nThe study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory \\\nof computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols \\\nas simple as \\\"0\\\" and \\\"1\\\", could simulate any conceivable act of \\\nmathematical deduction. This insight that digital computers can \\\nsimulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the \\\nChurch\[Dash]Turing thesis. This, along with concurrent discoveries \\\nin neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics, led researchers \\\nto consider the possibility of building an electronic brain. The \\\nfirst work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and \\\nPitts' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete \\\"artificial \\\nneurons\\\".The field of AI research was born at a workshop at \\\nDartmouth College in 1956. The attendees became the founders and \\\nleaders of AI research. They and their students produced programs \\\nthat the press described as \\\"astonishing\\\": computers were learning \\\ncheckers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving \\\nlogical theorems and speaking English. \nBy the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded \\\nby the Department of Defense and laboratories had been established \\\naround the world.Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were \\\nconvinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a \\\nmachine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the \\\ngoal of their field.
